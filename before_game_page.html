      The following game is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game made by Madison Shimbo,
      Baelul Haile, and Amber Martinez in which you, the user, are
      able to make choices that affect future given decisions and the plot of the story as
      you progress into the game. The game is focused on exploring the uses of Artificial
      Intelligence and the ethical tensions/issues that could possibly be faced by having

      advancements in this field has become a part of how we live and use the internet
      in our everyday lives over the course of the past decade. From personal assistants such as
      Siri and Alexa, autonomous driving, recommendation algorithms and predictive technologies
      found on social media platforms and streaming services, cybersecurity, and work done by
      other industries, AI has found its way into becoming an essential part of the technologies
      we use even in our day-to-day lives.
