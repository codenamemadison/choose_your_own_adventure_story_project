# Choose Your Own Adventure Story - Exploring The Future of AI

As the final project of our Ethics and Technology course, Madison Shimbo, Baelul Haile, and Amber Martinez decided to create a web-interactive Choose Your Own Adventure Game. The game is focused on exploring the uses of Artificial Intelligence and the ethical tensions/issues that could possibly be faced by having the user play the main character in a story revolving around these themes. Each decision made affects the next events and possible choices of the plot so be careful what you choose!
